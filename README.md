# Frequentist_Case_Study

There are two parts to the case study. In part A, you'll learn the Pythonic implementation of the concepts underlying 
frequentist inference. In Part B, you'll apply those implementations to a real-world scenario. 

Jupyter notebooks:

* Part A: [./Frequentist_Inference_Case_Study-Part-A_3.ipynb](./Frequentist_Inference_Case_Study-Part-A_3.ipynb)
* Part B: [./Frequentist_Inference_Case_Study-Part-B_2.ipynb](./Frequentist_Inference_Case_Study-Part-B_2.ipynb)

Covered topics:

* The z-statistic
* The t-statistic
* The Central Limit Theorem
* Estimation of the population standard deviation and mean, from a sample
* Sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean
* Calculating confidence intervals and p-values
* Hypothesis testing
